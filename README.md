# Gemini AI Clone Mini Project

This project is a clone of Gemini AI, implemented using React JS. Currently, there is no connection established with any API; the focus is primarily on building the UI with React.

## Features
- Gemini AI Clone: A replication of Gemini AI's user interface and features.
- React JS: Utilizing React for building a dynamic and interactive web application.
- Local Implementation: The project showcases the UI design and functionality locally without external API integration.

## Technologies Used

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run npm install to install dependencies.
4. Start the development server using npm run dev.
5. Access the project in your web browser at http://localhost:5173. (The local host is entirely depending on your system)

## Folder Structure
